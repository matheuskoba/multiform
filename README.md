# Multi-Steps Form Project
I created this project with react + typescript + styled-components + contextApi + react-router-dom

This form will register developers in multi-steps.

## Know-How
I used contextApi to save the global variables, because this is a simple project.

React-router-dom used to control the routes.

## Required to install
Node.js<br/>
